  /**
   * Creates a synchronized process array. A synchronized process array works

   * and the other one acts as a receiver.
   *
   * The sender allows full read-write access. Changes that have been made to
   * the sender can be sent to the receiver through the
   * {@link ProcessArray::send()} method. The receiver can be updated with these
   * changes by calling its {@link ProcessArray::receive()} method.
   *
   * The synchronization is implemented in a thread-safe manner, so that the
   * sender and the receiver can safely be used by different threads without
   * a mutex. However, both the sender and receiver each only support a single
   * thread. This means that the sender or the receiver have to be protected
   * with a mutex if more than one thread wants to access either of them.
   *
   * If the <code>swappable</code> flag is <code>true</code> (the default), the
   * receiver supports full read-write access (including swapping). If it is
   * <code>false</code>, only read-only access is supported. On the other hand,
   * setting this flag to <code>false</code> has the advantage that the sender's
   * {@link ProcessArray::getLastSent()} method can be used.
   *
   * The number of buffers specifies how many buffers are allocated for the
   * send / receive mechanism. The minimum number (and default) is two. This
   * number specifies, how many times {@link ProcessArray::send()} can be called
   * in a row without losing data when {@link ProcessArray::receive()} is not
   * called in between.
   *
   * The specified time-stamp source is used for determining the current time
   * when sending a value. The receiver will be updated with this time stamp
   * when receiving the value. If no time-stamp source is specified, the current
   * system-time when the value is sent is used.
   *
   * The optional send-notification listener is notified every time the sender's
   * {@link ProcessArray::send()} method is called. It can be used to queue a
   * request for the receiver's {@link ProcessArray::receive()} method to be
   * called.  The process variable passed to the listener is the receiver and
   * not the sender.
   *
   * The specified initial value is used for all the elements of the array.
