If you don't care if you lose data, but always want the latest value,
 you probably don't want to process all entries in the "filled buffers" queue
because only the last one contains the latest information.

You can simply receive until the queue is empty, and only use the latest value:

bool received = false;
while (processVariable->receive()){
  received=true;
}

If the queue was empty, received will still be false. Otherwise the queue has
 been emptied, and all except for the last entry have been discarded.
